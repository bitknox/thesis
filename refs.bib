    abstract = {In this work, we propose a framework to store and manage spatial data, which includes new efficient algorithms to perform operations accepting as input a raster dataset and a vector dataset. More concretely, we present algorithms for solving a spatial join between a raster and a vector dataset imposing a restriction on the values of the cells of the raster; and an algorithm for retrieving K objects of a vector dataset that overlap cells of a raster dataset, such that the K objects are those overlapping the highest (or lowest) cell values among all objects. The raster data is stored using a compact data structure, which can directly manipulate compressed data without the need for prior decompression. This leads to better running times and lower memory consumption. In our experimental evaluation comparing our solution to other baselines, we obtain the best space/time trade-offs.},

abstract = {Compact data structures are storage structures that combine a compressed representation of the data and the access mechanisms for retrieving individual data without the need of decompressing from the beginning. The target is to be able to keep the data always compressed, even in main memory, given that the data can be processed directly in that form. With this approach, we obtain several benefits: we can load larger datasets in main memory, we can make a better usage of the memory hierarchy, and we can obtain bandwidth savings in a distributed computational scenario, without wasting time in compressing and decompressing data during data exchanges. In this work, we follow a compact data structure approach to design a storage structure for raster data, which is commonly used to represent attributes of the space (temperatures, pressure, elevation measures, etc.) in geographical information systems. As it is common in compact data structures, our new technique is not only able to store and directly access compressed data, but also indexes its content, thereby accelerating the execution of queries. Previous compact data structures designed to store raster data work well when the raster dataset has few different values. Nevertheless, when the number of different values in the raster increases, their space consumption and search performance degrade. Our experiments show that our storage structure improves previous approaches in all aspects, especially when the number of different values is large, which is critical when applying over real datasets. Compared with classical methods for storing rasters, namely netCDF, our method competes in space and excels in access and query times.}

abstract = {Pre-processing spatial data for machine learning applications often includes combining different datasets into a form usable by the machine learning algorithms. Spatial data is generally available in two representations, raster and vector. The best data science and machine learning applications need to combine multiple datasets of both representations which is a data and compute intensive problem. This paper proposes a formal raster-vector join operator, Raptor Join, that can bridge the gap between raster and vector data. It is modeled as a relational join operator in Spark that can be easily combined with other operators, while also offering the advantage of in-situ processing. To implement the Raptor join operator efficiently, we propose a novel Flash index that has a low memory requirement and can process the entire operation with one data scan. We run an extensive experimental evaluation on large scale satellite data with up-to a trillion pixels, and big vector data with up-to hundreds of millions of segments and billions of points, and show that the proposed method can scale to big data with up-to three orders of magnitude performance gain over baselines.},

abstract = {We present a new variable-length encoding scheme for sequences of integers, Directly Addressable Codes (DACs), which enables direct access to any element of the encoded sequence without the need of any sampling method. Our proposal is a kind of implicit data structure that introduces synchronism in the encoded sequence without using asymptotically any extra space. We show some experiments demonstrating that the technique is not only simple, but also competitive in time and space with existing solutions in several applications, such as the representation of LCP arrays or high-order entropy-compressed sequences.}

Beast is based on well-established research and has been released to assist the research community with analyzing big spatio-temporal data. Beast provides a set of extensible components that naturally integrate with Spark to build exploratory data science pipelines. Beast can install in less than a minute on an existing Spark cluster and provides a wide array of features including loading vector and raster data represented in standard file formats, synthetic data generation for benchmarking, load-balanced spatial partitioning, data summarization, interactive visualization, and more. Beast builds on several research projects; its goal is to make all this research widely available to researchers in one integrative and coherent system.},

abstract = {The R-tree, one of the most popular access methods for rectangles, is based on the heuristic optimization of the area of the enclosing rectangle in each inner node. By running numerous experiments in a standardized testbed under highly varying data, queries and operations, we were able to design the R*-tree which incorporates a combined optimization of area, margin and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the directory. Using our standardized testbed in an exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that the R*-tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree variants. Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the R*-tree holds for different types of queries and operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a practical point of view the R*-tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons 1 it efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2 its implementation cost is only slightly higher than that of other R-trees.},
