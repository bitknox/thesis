        This thesis introduces the \raven system for computing joins of raster data with vector data. It supports filtering the results based on raster-values and an option to make the join significantly faster if only pixel coordinates and not values are desired as the output. \raven is a single-machine system which provides an alternative to the mostly distributed systems that currently exists. 
        
        We analyse \raven's performance compared to the state-of-the-art system with real-world data. We also highlight different types of data that impact the performance of \raven.
        
        The goal of developing the \raven system was to make a system that offers good performance compared to the existing systems, while being more tailored for single-machine use.
